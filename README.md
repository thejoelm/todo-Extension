# todo-Extension

I made this personal project to be able to learn more about lists used in chrome extension, as well as imporve my knowledge in HTML and JavaSript, and understand the correlation between Java and Javascript. I also created this project to help me to order my items and tasks more efficiently

#How to Use

To use, create a folder to store the files, then download the files provided into the folder. Then, in Chrome Extensions using developer mode, load the folder into Chrome and enable it, where it should then be usable.
